                    Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting that tends to focus on
                    a
                    "combination of lowlife and high tech",[1] featuring futuristic technological and scientific
                    achievements,
                    such
                    as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with societal collapse, dystopia or decay.[2]
                    Much of
                    cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers
                    like
                    Philip K.
                    Dick, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer and Harlan
                    Ellison
                    examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the
                    utopian
                    tendencies
                    of earlier science fiction.

                    Comics exploring cyberpunk themes began appearing as early as Judge Dredd, first published in
                    1977.[3]
                    Released
                    in 1984, William Gibson's influential debut novel Neuromancer helped solidify cyberpunk as a genre,
                    drawing
                    influence from punk subculture and early hacker culture. Other influential cyberpunk writers
                    included
                    Bruce
                    Sterling and Rudy Rucker. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro
                    Otomo's
                    manga series Akira, with its 1988 anime film adaptation (also directed by Otomo) later popularizing
                    the
                    subgenre.

            Early films in the genre include Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner, one of several of Philip K. Dick's
            works
            that have been adapted into films (in this case, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?). The "first cyberpunk
            television series"[4] was the TV series Max Headroom from 1987, playing in a futuristic dystopia ruled by an
            oligarchy of television networks, and where computer hacking played a central role in many story lines. The
            films Johnny Mnemonic (1995)[5] and New Rose Hotel (1998),[6][7] both based upon short stories by William
            Gibson, flopped commercially and critically, while The Matrix trilogy (1999–2003) and Judge Dredd (1995)
            were
            some of the most successful cyberpunk films.

            Newer cyberpunk media includes Blade Runner 2049 (2017), a sequel to the original 1982 film; Dredd (2012),
            which
            was not a sequel to the original movie; Upgrade (2018); Alita: Battle Angel (2019), based on the 1990s
            Japanese
            manga Battle Angel Alita; the 2018 Netflix TV series Altered Carbon, based on Richard K. Morgan's 2002 novel
            of
            the same name; the 2020 remake of 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII; and the video game
            Cyberpunk
            2077 (2020), based on R. Talsorian Games's 1988 tabletop role-playing game Cyberpunk.
